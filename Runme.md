# Existing data generated after my test

There are data (csv and sql) available in data folder. These data were generated after running my code/test.
It can be explored if needs be.

# Run the test

To run this code/test, first archive the current data (csv and sql), then delete the ones in the work station in order to have new generated data once the test/code is run.

Thanks,
Nganpet.
